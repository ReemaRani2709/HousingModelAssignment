## General Information
- Background: Identify the factors which can contributes in housing price prediction
- Business Problem: Model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market. 
- Dataset: Table having 1460 rows and 81 columns, having numerical and categorical independent variables 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The optimal value of alpha for ridge regression is 100 and for lasso regression it is 500.
- 160 features got selected by Lasso REgression on optimal alpha value
